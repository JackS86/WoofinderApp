# WOOFinder

Final group project, in which we are tasked with creating a full-fledged internet application

# What is WOOFinder?

WOOFinder is an application where you can add adverts for missing dogs. Ultimately, another user will be able to add an appropriate comment, if he saw the dog from the notification

# What libraries did we use?

- react
- react-router-dom
- react-hook-form
- styled-components
- material-ui
- query-string
- firebase
- react-google-maps/api
- formik  

### Despite the end of the bootcamp, we have plans to further develop our application. There are still many ideas that could not be implemented due to the deadline.
